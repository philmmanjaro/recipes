Subject: [PATCH 02/28] platform/x86: asus-wmi: don't fail if platform_profile
 already registered

On some newer laptops it appears that an AMD driver can register a
platform_profile handler. If this happens then the asus_wmi driver would
error with -EEXIST when trying to register its own handler leaving the
user with a possibly unusable system - this is especially true for
laptops with an MCU that emit a stream of HID packets, some of which can
be misinterpreted as shutdown signals.

We can safely continue loading the driver instead of bombing out.
